## Abstract:
Microbial secondary metabolites play important roles in biotic interactions in microbial communities and yet, we do not understand how these compounds impact the assembly and development of microbial communities. To address the implications of microbial secondary metabolite production on biotic interactions in the assembly of natural seawater microbiomes, we constructed a model system where the assembly of a natural seawater biofilm community was influenced by the addition of the marine biofilm forming Phaeobacter inhibens that can produce the antibiotic secondary metabolite tropodithietic acid (TDA), or a mutant incapable of TDA production. Because of the broad antibiotic activity of TDA, we hypothesized that the potential of P. inhibens to produce TDA would strongly affect both biofilm and planktonic community assembly patterns. We show that 1.9% of the microbial composition variance across both environments could be attributed to the presence of WT P. inhibens, and especially genera of the Bacteriodetes were increased by presence of the TDA producer. Moreover, network analysis with inferred putative microbial interactions revealed that P. inhibens mainly displayed strong positive associations with genera of the Flavobacteriaceae and Alteromonadaceae, and that P. inhibens acts as a keystone OTU in the biofilm exclusively due to its potential to produce TDA. Our results demonstrate the potential impact of microbial secondary metabolites on microbial interactions and assembly dynamics of complex microbial communities.

### Scripts
All scripts used for analysis can be found in 'Rscripts/'. 

Pre-processing of the ASV table and rarefaction curves: 
- phylo_main_no_cont_NoOutliers.R

Low abundant read cut-off were analysed and determined in "Filtration210921.R". 

The alpha-diversity analysis, including Table 1 and Figure S1 were created with "alpha_161121.R". 
The beta-analysis including beta-dispersion, PERMANOVA (Table 1), posthoc test for pair-wise differences within each variable (Table 2), scree and NMDS plots (Figure 2) were analysed in "Beta-diversity_131022.R"

The differential analysis using the ANCOM-BC model comparing all groups were created with "ANCOMBC_040422.R" and the final compison between the WT and dTDA samples from either the biofilm or the planktonic suspesion at day 4 were vizualised in Figure 3. 

Network analyses comparing the WT and the dTDA microbiome of each day from both environments, respectively were carried out in "NetCoMi_030122.R" including Figure 4A. Positive and negative correlations between the 'P. inhibens OTU' and other genera at day 4 in the biofilm were extracted from the NetComi constructed network WT and dTDA comparison and their respective LogFC changes (dertermined in "ANCOMBC_040422.R") were combined in Figure 4B. The netCompare function was used to calculate significant changes between the network cetrality measures (betweenness, degree, closeness, and eigenvector centrality) between the WT and the dTDA networks constructed on samples from either the biofilm or the planktonic suspension at each day, respectively and to determine keystones. All network scores and p-values were summerized in Table S1. 

Absolutte population and Phaeobacter spp. abundances were analysed in "qPCR_040422.R" (Table 1; Figure 1)
